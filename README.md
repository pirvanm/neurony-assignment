# Let's have some fun

I just played a bit with this project, the actual assignment was simple so why not have some fun with
good old vue 2, been using vue 3 for a while.

The same logic is there, I just added filters feature, just to make things more interesting.

I used mailtrap to test mail sending.

I tried to make that one page act like an SPA, for example how inertia works, as best I could do given
a short period of time.

No tests, and no docker for this, but can be added.


Migrate, seed and have fun testing!
